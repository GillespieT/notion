  purge-log-air-sample-bags<br/>
    The air sample bags are cleaned ("purged") by exchanging the total air volume at least 3 times.<br/>
    The bags' contents must sit for at least 10 minutes between volume exchanges.<br/>
    This code was used in a Property (Type: Function) to tell me when each bag was ready for its next volume exchange<br/>
    (or ready to be emptied and stored, if the volume changes were complete).<br/>
