  purge-log-air-sample-bags
    The air sample bags are cleaned ("purged") by exchanging the total air volume at least 3 times.
    The bags' contents must sit for at least 10 minutes between volume exchanges.
    This code was used in a Property (Type: Function) to tell me when each bag was ready for its next volume exchange
    (or ready to be emptied and stored, if the volume changes were complete).
